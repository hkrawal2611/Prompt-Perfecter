## üòµ The Problem: Prompt Purgatory

We've all been there. You *know* the quality of the answer depends heavily on the quality of the question, but translating a brilliant idea into a prompt an LLM truly understands can feel like wrestling a digital octopus. The results? Often generic, slightly off-topic, or just plain... *meh*. You waste time re-writing, re-phrasing, and hoping for the best.

## üí° The Solution: Your AI Co-Pilot

Prompt Perfecter injects a simple **"‚ú® Perfecter"** button right into the LLM interface.

1.  **Write your draft prompt:** Just get your initial thoughts down.
2.  **Click "‚ú® Perfecter":** Let Prompt Perfecter work its magic! It sends your draft (and your chosen enhancement style) to the powerful Google Gemini model via *your own secure API key*.
3.  **Get Suggestions:** See the refined prompt instantly in a neat suggestion box.
4.  **Click "Use This":** Seamlessly replace your original draft with the perfected version.
5.  **Send to LLM:** Watch as the LLM delivers significantly better, more relevant, and insightful responses!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

1.  **Content Script (`content.js`):** Injects the "‚ú® Perfecter" button and suggestion UI onto supported LLM pages. Detects user clicks and grabs the current prompt text.
2.  **Popup (`popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`):** Allows users to securely save their Google Gemini API key via `chrome.storage.sync` and configure settings.
3.  **Background Script (`background.js`):** Acts as a secure intermediary. Receives requests from the content script, makes the actual API call to the Google Gemini API using the user's stored key, and sends the enhanced prompt back.
4.  **Google Gemini API:** The AI brain that rewrites and improves the prompts based on the user's text and selected style.
