**Struggle to get your ideas across to AI? Wish you could instantly rephrase your text for clear, professional communication? Your personal writing assistant is here.** ü§ù

Prompt Perfecter is a Chrome Extension that acts as your intelligent communication bridge. It helps you refine your text for two distinct purposes: creating crystal-clear prompts for AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and rephrasing your thoughts into polished, human-readable language.

**Think of it as an empathy layer between you and your digital world. üöÄ**

## üòµ The Problem: The Language Gap

We've all been there. You have a brilliant idea, but translating it into a prompt that an LLM truly understands can feel like wrestling a digital octopus. The results? Often generic, slightly off-topic, or just plain... *meh*. You waste time re-writing, re-phrasing, and hoping for the best.

Interacting with advanced AI is powerful, but it's only effective if the AI truly understands your intent. For many, translating thoughts into precise, grammatically correct prompts can be a major hurdle. Similarly, quickly drafting a professional message can be challenging.

The result? Your brilliant ideas get lost in translation, and you spend more time re-writing than getting results.

## üí° The Solution: A Dual-Purpose AI Assistant

Prompt Perfecter adds a simple floating "‚ú®" button to your favorite AI chat sites. When you click it, you don't just get one suggestion‚Äîyou get two, side-by-side, each tailored for a specific goal:

</p>

1.  **ü§ñ Refined for AI:** This version is meticulously structured to be an effective prompt. It clarifies your intent, corrects grammar, and formats your text so that the LLM can understand it perfectly, leading to dramatically better and more accurate responses.
2.  **üë§ Rephrased for Humans:** This version focuses on improving your text for human communication. It enhances clarity, grammar, and flow, making it perfect for emails, messages, or documents. You can even adjust its tone (e.g., formal, conversational, concise) with a single click!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

1.  **Content Script (`content.js`):** Injects the floating "‚ú®" button and the two-column results UI onto supported pages.
2.  **Popup & Options (popup.html, options.html):** Allows you to securely save your Google Gemini API key to chrome.storage.sync and enable/disable the extension.
3.  **Parallel API Calls:** When you click the button, the content script makes two simultaneous API calls to the Google Gemini API using your key, each with a specialized system prompt to generate the "AI-refined" and "Human-rephrased" versions.
4.  **Google Gemini API:** The AI brain that rewrites and improves the prompts based on the user's text and selected style.
